# Changelog

## 4.5.0

- Rename: formbase is now Formstep, at formstep.io. Every label, help text, sample and error message says Formstep, and the package is `formstep-zapier`. No trigger, action, search, input or auth key changes, so existing Zaps keep their mappings.
- Update the API host: API calls and the OAuth authorize, token and refresh endpoints default to `https://api.formstep.io` instead of `https://api.formbase.so`. `BASE_URL` still overrides it. Existing connections stay: both hosts serve the same backend, so a token issued before the switch refreshes on the new host without reconnecting.
- Update every trigger: a delivery is verified against `X-Formstep-Signature`, and the event headers are `X-Formstep-Event-Id` and `X-Formstep-Event-Type`. They replace `X-formbase-Signature`, `X-formbase-Event-Id` and `X-formbase-Event-Type`. The server sends only the new names, so this version ships together with the server switch: an older version rejects every delivery once the server sends the new headers. Subscriptions keep their signing secret, so no Zap needs to be turned off and on.
- Update create/create_request and create/get_request: the sample request link reads `https://form.formstep.io/r/rq_example`. It said `forms.formbase.so`, but share links are served from `form.`.

## 4.4.2

- Update create/create_request help texts. A hidden-field (context) value comes back in the request's Context and among the answers, which 4.4.1 got wrong. Delivery says Email needs a Pro or Business plan and that a filled-in Recipient Email gets the form's scheduled reminders even with None. External ID says reusing it with different inputs within 30 days fails. Behaviour is unchanged.

## 4.4.1

- Update create/create_request: the help text of each hidden-field (context) input now says what formbase does with it. The recipient cannot change the value and sees it only where the form mentions it, and it comes back in the request's Context, not in the answers. The old text said the recipient never sees it and that it comes back in the answers. Behaviour is unchanged.

## 4.4.0

- Update create/create_request, create/get_request, create/remind_request, create/cancel_request and search/find_request: times arrive as ISO 8601 dates (`2026-09-27T16:53:00.000Z`) instead of epoch milliseconds, the same shape the triggers deliver, so Zapier formats and compares them as dates. Covers every `…At` field and each Get Request timeline entry's `at`. The labels lose their `(ms)`. A Zap that did arithmetic on the old number needs Formatter's date tools instead.
- Update every answer output: where a question's field key reads differently from its title, the label names the key too, as in "Your Decision (decision)" and "Your Decision (decision, display)". Zapier names a mapped field by its key path ("Data › Answers › Decision"), so the test record and the mapped field now read alike. Keys are unchanged, so existing mappings keep working.
- Update create/create_request: the Test Request help text says a test request starts no Zap. Request triggers fire for real requests only.

## 4.3.0

- Update create/create_request: attach documents. A form with a Documents block offers a Documents input for files from earlier steps; the recipient opens and downloads them in the form, below the documents the form already has. Each file is uploaded through `documents.create` before the request is created, keeps its own file name, and is checked by formbase against its size and sha256. A replayed Zap with the same External ID gets the original request back even though it uploads its files again; this needs a formbase backend that counts a document by its bytes for idempotency. A form with several Documents blocks also asks which block they go into, and a run that attaches files without one fails before anything is uploaded.
- Update create/get_request, create/remind_request and create/cancel_request: the Request input offers a dropdown of the newest requests, labelled by recipient, status and External ID, and a Find Request step can be added inline to fill it. Get Request lists the requests of its picked form. A mapped Request ID works as before.
- Update every Form dropdown: a form that is not published yet reads "(not published)". Create Request needs a published form; the triggers can be wired up before publishing.
- Internal: the six REST hook triggers come from one factory, and the request and submission samples share their envelope, submission, booking and payment pieces. Behaviour and outputs are unchanged.
- Internal: zapier-platform-core 19.1.0, Jest 30, nock 14; CI runs Zapier's structural validation.

## 4.2.0

- Update every submission and request trigger and Get Request: a Schedule appointment answer and a Payment answer each map property by property. A booking gives Status, Start, End, Time Zone, Attendee Name, Attendee Email, Meeting URL, Event Title, Provider and Provider Booking ID; a payment gives Status, Amount, Currency, Amount Refunded, Receipt URL, Paid At, Refunded At, Disputed At, Provider and Provider Payment Intent ID. The `(display)` field keeps one line of text for each. The samples carry both.
- Behaviour change from formbase (event `apiVersion` `2026-09-24`), not from this version: a booking answer is an object, not a sentence. A Zap that mapped the booking answer itself now receives an object; map one of its properties, or the booking's `(display)` field for the old sentence. A Payment question used to have no answer; it now has one.

## 4.1.0

- Update every submission and request trigger: add Last Edited At (`data.submission.updatedAt`) and Edit Count (`data.submission.editCount`), so a Zap can tell a fresh submission from one the respondent changed afterwards. Last Edited At is empty until the first edit; Edit Count starts at 0. The samples carry both fields.

## 4.0.0

- Breaking: remove trigger/public_link_submission and add trigger/public_link_submission_created: Public Link Submission Created under the key that matches its label and its Updated and Abandoned siblings. Behaviour is unchanged. Zaps built on `public_link_submission` do not migrate; rebuild them on Public Link Submission Created. No 3.0.0 Zap exists, so nothing needs rebuilding.

## 3.0.0

- Breaking: replace the Event field of Public Link Submission with one trigger per event. Triggers show up in Zapier's trigger picker, where an option inside a dropdown does not, and each trigger now carries only the inputs its event needs.
  - Update trigger/public_link_submission: renamed Public Link Submission Created. It fires for new submissions only (`submission.completed`) and has no Event field.
  - Add trigger/public_link_submission_updated (Public Link Submission Updated): fires when a respondent edits a submission they already sent through the public link (`submission.updated`). The form must allow editing after submit.
  - Add trigger/public_link_submission_abandoned (Public Link Submission Abandoned): fires when a public-link draft sits idle past its window (`submission.abandoned`). The idle window is a required field of this trigger.
  - Each trigger rejects a delivery of another event type, like the request triggers do.
  - Update trigger/request_completed: the Form help text names Public Link Submission Created.
- Migration: a Zap that set Event to Submission updated or Submission abandoned moves to the matching trigger. A Zap on Submission created keeps working as Public Link Submission Created. No 2.x version has live Zaps, so nothing is migrated automatically.

## 2.1.0

- Update trigger/public_link_submission: add the Submission updated event. It fires when a respondent edits a submission they already sent through the public link (the form must allow editing after submit), and its test sample carries `type: submission.updated`.
- Behaviour change: a Zap on Submission created no longer runs when a respondent edits a submission. It receives new submissions only (`submission.completed`). To act on edits, add a Zap on Submission updated.

## 2.0.1

- Update trigger/public_link_submission: the description says it also fires when a respondent updates a submission; shorter Form and Event help.
- Update trigger/request_completed, trigger/request_expired, trigger/request_canceled: shorter descriptions and help.

## 2.0.0

- Remove trigger/submission and add trigger/public_link_submission: the same trigger under the key that matches its label. Zaps built on `submission` do not migrate; rebuild them on Public Link Submission. Zapier requires a major version for a removed trigger.

## 1.3.1

- Update trigger/submission: renamed to Public Link Submission, so the trigger list says which channel it covers.
- Update trigger/request_completed: the description says it is the only event a completed request fires.

## 1.3.0

- Update trigger/submission: fire for share-link submissions only. A completed request no longer fires the Submission trigger (formbase ADR 0030, one channel, one event), so a Zap on Submission and a Zap on Request Completed run one each per completion and the Filter on Request ID is no longer needed. The Request ID and Request External ID outputs are gone from the Submission trigger, since no event it receives can carry them; a Zap that wants every answer, whichever channel produced it, is one Zap on each trigger.
- Update trigger/request_completed: the Form help text no longer warns about a second event on the Submission trigger.

## 1.2.0

- Add create/create_request: create a request for a form. The editor loads one input per prefillable field key, one per hidden field marked as context, and a multi-select of the prefilled keys to lock, all from `fields.list`; recipient, language, delivery, reminders, expiry, external id, metadata and test mode are plain inputs. The external id doubles as the idempotency key, so a replayed Zap run reuses the request. The output carries the share link.
- Add create/cancel_request, create/remind_request and create/get_request: cancel a request with an optional reason, send a reminder, and read a request back with its answers and display keyed by field key.
- Add search/find_request: find requests by external id within a form or across the connected workspace, optionally including test requests.
- Add trigger/request_completed, trigger/request_expired and trigger/request_canceled: REST Hooks that fire when a request is completed, expires or is canceled. Each subscribes with its own event type, rejects a delivery of another type, and tests against `requests.sample`. Request Completed also carries the submission, answers and display; the other two carry the request block alone.
- Update trigger/submission: keep firing for a completed request, and say in the Form help text that a Zap which should react only to requests uses Request Completed. Subscribe, unsubscribe, signature verification, output-field building and the PDF hydrator now live in `utils/` and are shared with the request triggers.

## 1.1.1

- Update trigger/submission: describe the trigger in terms of requests. It fires when a customer completes a request or submits a form, and the Form help text says a request created for the form carries Request ID and Request External ID.

## 1.1.0

- Update trigger/submission: read the formbase event envelope (`id`, `type`, `createdAt`, `apiVersion`, `test`, `data`) that replaced the flat payload; `fields[]` is gone and every answer arrives once in `data.answers` with its readable text in `data.display`.
- Update trigger/submission: build output fields per form from `fields.list`, so mapped fields carry the question's title and key instead of a generic `fields[]` line item. A matrix gets one field per row, and the request a submission answered is offered as Request ID / Request External ID.
- Update trigger/submission: the PDF file hydrates from `data.submission.pdfUrl` (was `submission.submissionPdfLink`), and an event that carries a PDF without the ids to hydrate it now fails loudly instead of dropping the PDF File output.
- Update trigger/submission: an unpublished form lists the envelope outputs alone (`fields.list` answers `published: false`), so a Zap can be wired up before the form is published; any other `fields.list` failure surfaces instead of hiding the answer fields.
- Update trigger/form_list: list the connected workspace's forms across every `forms.list` page. An OAuth token is scoped to one workspace, so the workspace prefix is gone.
- Update app: drop the `beforeRequest` Bearer middleware, which also ran on the OAuth token and refresh requests; the JSON-RPC client sets its own header.

## 1.0.0

- Update trigger/submission: support completed and abandoned submission events with selectable idle windows.
- Fix trigger/submission: expose abandoned deliveries as `ABANDON_RESPONSE` in live payloads and test samples.
- Update trigger/submission: verify signed formbase webhook deliveries and expose submission language, PDFs, and repeating-group values.
